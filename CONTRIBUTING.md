# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [issues](https://github.com/pingnow/pingtocoffee/issues), we will answer and check whether it is necessary or not.

### 1. Pick an issue and start fix.

You are a developer and you think it has some issues you can fix. Please comment on that issue and notice to me and other's people know you will work to fix it.

### 2. Fork and create branch.

Fork the repository and create a branch with the name follow this rule(recommend): `id-issue_title`.

Example: `123-fix-validation-name`

**Note:** The issue_title no need totally same with the real issue's title, you can change it and make it easier to understand.

### 3. Write the test case.

We are using `phpunit` to cover the test for the backend. So if your PR contents the logic change and it needs the test cases, please write and run the test before creating PR.

Make sure you follow the [instructions](https://github.com/pingnow/pingtocoffee/tree/master/docs/contribute/index.md) on how to setup the test suite.

### 4. Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/pingnow/pingtocoffee/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/pingnow/pingtocoffee/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or **an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### 5. Implement your fix or feature.

- At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

- Write a good commit message. To write good commit messages, please follow those recommendations. There are important to maintain an healthy commit logs.

- If there are multiple commits in your pull request, these commits will be squashed before merging. Please make sure, if that's the case, that your pull request has a nice description explaining what it does.

- It's okay to have work-in-progress pull requests. Add [WIP] in the title of your pull request if that's the case, otherwise your pull request will be considered in a state of being able to be merged as is.

- If you wish to appear as a contributor, update the CONTRIBUTORS file and add your name to it. Include this change in your pull request.

### 6. Wait for the code to be reviewed.

It can take several days before we can review the code you've submitted. We all have a lot of work to do and while we truly appreciate pull requests that are submitted, we can't review them instantly. We'll do our best to review them as fast as possible, but there are only 24 hours in a day and we can't sometimes be as fast as we wish we were. Moreover, there are little chances that the PR will be reviewed over the weekend, a time dedicated to spend time with friends and families (those you manage with this project anyway :-)).

Also, keep in mind that this project is still a side project. Maintainers of this project are not paid to work on it. Everything they do, is done during their time off of their "real" job, that means at night, on the weekend and during holidays.

### 7. What can I contribute to?

Even the simplest change is appreciated. It can be a typo error, translating the application in a new language, fix a bug. No change is too small.

- If your contribution involves a change in the UI (even if it's very small), please ping @henryonsoftware in an issue before you start working on it, explaining what you want to achieve, why and how. We want to maintain a high level of visual quality in the software and we will dismiss all pull requests that change the front end that have not been discussed before-hand.
